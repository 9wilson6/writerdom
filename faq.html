<center><h1>Freqeuntly Asked Questions</h1></center>
<ol>
  <li> <h4>When I am in need to share documents with my tutors such as a draft or an outline; how do I go about that?</h4>
   <p>You are advised to have all the information necessary to share compiled prior to the placing of an order. This is because you only get to share these documents while drafting your order.</p>
    </li>
  <li><h4>What format do you use in your customer service?</h4>
    <p>Our tutors are well educated and better exposed when it comes to academic assistance. This means that you are provided with an option to choose your most preferred style and the tutors will provide you with assistance with this regard. The options available are APA/ MLA/ Chicago or Turabian/ Not Applicable. The Not Applicable option mostly applies for a resume where work is presented as a plain Microsoft document. </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>I have forgotten my password, please assist</h4> 
    <p>When this happens you will only need to have information on your account details. This information will allow you to reset your password. You will only need to click on the ‘reset password’ option provided below the ‘login’ option provided.</p>
     </li>
  <li> <h4>Is the order submission at www.perfectgrader.com free?</h4>

   <p>Yes, the order submission process is free. In addition, the review of the tutors is free; this includes the brief introduction you are allowed to request from tutors to assess their competence. A deposit to your balance is only expected when you have chosen your tutor so as to reserve your order.</p>
 </li>
  <li><h4>Are you socially accountable for your content?</h4> 
    <p>Yes, we are socially responsible. It is for these reasons that we do not provide content on any controversial matters that are considered to be against established social morals. Some of the topics we do not tutor on include abortion and homosexuality. Orders on controversial topics are automatically cancelled.</p> 
  </li>
  <li><h4>When will my paper be completed?</h4> 
  <p>As you place your order, it is expected of you to provide a deadline. Work is submitted in accordance with this deadline with the exception of any communication with your tutor to effect change to the said deadline. Nevertheless, it is important to share information on these changes with your tutor in good time. The necessity of communication in due time is due to the workload and schedule variability of the tutor. These changes are communicated through the chat option provided between you and your tutor.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <h4>How is the service or work ordered received?</h4> 
    <p>When full payment to the tutor has been met, you are at liberty to download the document you requested in either format of your choice. The available choices include an MS word document option or a PDF format. The options will appear on your personal webpage. You are free to save the file on your device.</p>
     </li>
  <li><h4>Am I allowed to modify my order details? </h4>
  <p>Modification is only applicable during the tutor’s bidding stage. You are provided with an option to edit order details at the time. However, after every modification, all bids are considered invalid and the tutors have to rebid based on the updated order. The editing option is unavailable for work where a tutor has already been assigned. The tutor at this point works in accordance with your initial guidelines. You can modify the number of pages, date of submission, the title of the task among others.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <h4>What happens if I am discontented with the service delivered?</h4> 
    <p>Kindly express such concerns to the tutor as soon as you can. This saves on time and avoids a lot of input on work that displeases you. You are best equipped to identify any errors and misinterpretation of your instructions as work progresses.  If the status of the submission is completed, you cannot express such discontent. The status changes when the order is completed and the bid balance, as well as the tutor balance, met. You are advised to request revisions prior to completion of the order. If the order is complete, you can only place another order for either rewriting or editing.</p> 
  </li>
  <li> <h4>What is the rewriting or editing service?</h4> 
    <p>This service is only applicable when you have a draft or a completed paper and would love input by professionals so as to improve the content. Editing involves a 30% change in the content while rewriting is extensive and results in a 70% change. Editing is done through proofreading and a slight change in content while rewriting, on top of that, adds a revision to this process.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <h4>How do I confirm the authenticity of a paper?</h4> <p>Our website recognizes the need to provide original work. We offer a free plagiarism check option that can be used without limit. You are advised to check for plagiarism as soon as the tutor provides an update on your work so that the work is satisfactory from the beginning. The tutor should submit work with a low similarity index.</p> </li>
  <li><h4>Can I delete my account?</h4> <p>Yes, you can. The delete option is provided for. However, if you come to need our services in future you will need to create a new account. This is because you cannot restore your previous account and neither can our support team.</p> </li>
